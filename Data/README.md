# Data
This page includes most data used during the experiments. The Citi Bike trip data is too large to be uploaded to Github, so the data is summarized into data.dat.

* data.dat: summarizes Citi Bike data, weather.csv, and repair.csv into data points
* .pt files: trained neural networks
  * demand.pt and repair.pt: the networks for the first and second tasks, respectively
  * demand2.pt and repair2.pt: the networks for the first and second tasks with non-detailed input, respectively
 * stations.dat: indicates which station belongs to which cluster
